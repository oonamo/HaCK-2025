# Cloning the project 

- Clone the repository by running 'git clone (url)'
- Once you're in the directory you just cloned, run the following code to remove the existing .git file:

Windows:
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .git

Mac:
rm -rf .git

- Finally, create a new repository on github, and add your code to it.

# Backend and Frontend setup

- In the backend directory, create a file named '.env', and add the following:

- CONNECT_URL=mqtts://(your URL):(your port)

- MQTT_USER=(your user)

- MQTT_PASS=(your pass)

- Then, while in the backend directory, install the dependencies by running
### `npm install`
- You can start the backend by running 
### `node index.js`

- In a separate terminal, in the frontend directory, install the dependencies by running
### `npm install`
- You can start the frontend by running 
### `npm start`

# Using connections.py for your Pico 2W

- You will be able to use 2 functions in connections.py
    - One for connection to the MQTT broker (connect_mqtt) and one for connecting to WIFI (connect_internet)

    - connect_mqtt(mqtt_server, mqtt_user, mqtt_pass):

        - mqtt_server: the server url which you have obtained by making a free serverless MQTT Broker on HIVEMQ
            - Should look something like: '37##616##db7#bd1##cac997eb01##13.s1.eu.hivemq.cloud'

        - mqtt_user:
            - This is the name of the user you create when you make a credential
                - The purpose of this is just to have a unique user in which the MQTT Broker can understand where the message is coming from 
                - Ex: username = 'pico' when creating credentials for the Raspberry Pi Pico W to send something

        - mqtt_pass:
            - This is the password that goes along with your mqtt_user
            - Just for the broker to validate the user
            - Make this whatever you want, just write it down

        - RETURNS client, which you can use 
            - client.subscribe(b"topic") to subscribe to a topic of your choice
            - client.publish(b"topic", b"message") to publish a message with a topic of your choice
            - client

    - connect_internet( ssid, password ):
        
        - ssid: 
            - This is the name of the wi-fi network you are trying to connect to

        - password:
            - this is the password of the wi-fi network you are trying to connect to

# Cam_Setup folder

- Code to program the camera has been provided to you.
- Follow the instructions on the readme located within the Cam_Setup folder to set up your esp-32.\

# Todo:
- Implement API calls using the starter python code in the 'AI' folder
- Program the esp-32 according to the readme
- Fill out App.js in the frontend folder to customize your website and add the appropriate communication channels (use index.js in the backend as a reference)
- Program your pico, adding functionality for any electrical components. You can edit the code on vscode and then transfer files to the pico via thonny, or you can edit the code directly on the pico using thonny.
